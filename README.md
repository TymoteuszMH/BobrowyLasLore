This project was made for my colleague, the name references to our discord server name.
It was made in Angular and Django.
Sites modules: 
Login module with sign in and sign up forms in it,
User module where user can change account data,
Post module with 3 functions: showing posts list depending on it's type, showing each post details, adding, editing and removing posts.

You can activate local servers with batch files located in .bat forlder.

You can visit site on: https://bll-ui.vercel.app/

!rundjango.bat is downloading needed venv packages, but you still need to download node.js and angular on your own!
